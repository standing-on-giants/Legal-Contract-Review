EXCLUSIVITY AND NO-SHOP

8.1 Upon execution of this Term Sheet, Target agrees to a 60-day exclusivity period
    during which Target shall not solicit, initiate, or participate in any discussions
    with other potential acquirers.
8.2 This exclusivity obligation is binding and legally enforceable notwithstanding
    the non-binding nature of other provisions of this Term Sheet.
8.3 If Target breaches the exclusivity obligation, Target shall pay Acquirer a
    break-up fee of $2,100,000 (5% of Base Purchase Price) as liquidated damages.
8.4 No reciprocal obligation is imposed on Acquirer. During the exclusivity period,

FINANCING

9.1 Acquirer represents that it has received a financing commitment letter from
    First National Capital sufficient to fund the Base Purchase Price.
9.2 The financing commitment is subject to customary conditions including satisfactory
    due diligence by the lender, absence of a market disruption event as determined
    by the lender in its sole discretion, and final credit committee approval.
9.3 If Acquirer's financing fails for any reason, Acquirer may terminate this
    Agreement with no liability to Target, provided Acquirer gives Target written
    notice of such termination within five (5) Business Days of the financing failure.
9.4 No reverse termination fee or other compensation is payable to Target in the
    event of a financing failure.

TAX MATTERS

10.1 The transaction is structured as an asset purchase. Target shareholders shall
     bear all income taxes arising from the transaction.
10.2 Deferred revenue that has been recognized by Target for accounting purposes
     but not yet earned may be treated as taxable income at Closing by the IRS.
     The parties have not agreed on which party bears this deferred revenue tax
     liability, and it is not addressed in the Working Capital definition or
     Fundamental Representations.
10.3 Any transfer taxes arising from the asset purchase shall be shared equally
     by the parties.
10.4 Acquirer shall have sole authority over all tax filings post-Closing, including
     the right to amend any pre-Closing period tax returns, and shall not require
     Target shareholder consent for such amendments.
""".strip(),

    "schedule_a_open_source": """
SCHEDULE A — INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS

A.1 The following components of Target's software stack incorporate open-source
    software licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3):
      - DataSync Engine v2.1 (core data synchronization module)
      - ReportBuilder v1.4 (customer-facing reporting module)

    These components together constitute approximately 34% of Target's codebase
    by lines of code. Under GPLv3, any distribution of software incorporating
    these components may trigger copyleft obligations requiring disclosure of
    Acquirer's proprietary source code.

A.2 Target has not obtained commercial licenses for the above components.
    Target's legal counsel has opined that current use is internal and does
    not trigger distribution obligations. However, if Acquirer distributes
    the combined software to customers (as Acquirer's current business model
    requires), copyleft obligations will likely be triggered.

A.3 Remediation options: (a) obtain commercial licenses from copyright holders
    (estimated cost $180,000–$400,000), or (b) rewrite affected modules
    (estimated 8–14 months of engineering effort).

A.4 Target's IP representations in Section 3.4 of the Term Sheet state that no
    material IP is subject to copyleft licenses. Schedule A contradicts this
    representation. No qualification or cross-reference corrects Section 3.4.
""".strip(),

    "schedule_b_earnout_definition": """
SCHEDULE B — EARNOUT DEFINITIONS

B.1 "Annual Recurring Revenue" (ARR) for purposes of the Earnout shall mean
    the annualized value of recurring subscription contracts in force as of
    the measurement date, excluding:
      (i)   one-time implementation or professional services fees;
      (ii)  contracts with remaining term less than six (6) months;
      (iii) contracts originated through channel partners unless approved
            by Acquirer's CFO in writing prior to contract execution;
      (iv)  any customer contract that Acquirer elects to terminate or
            not renew post-Closing, regardless of the reason for non-renewal.

B.2 ARR shall be calculated by Acquirer in its sole and absolute discretion.
    Target's representative may audit the calculation within 30 days of Acquirer's
    delivery of the ARR statement. Audit findings are advisory only — Acquirer's
    calculation is final and binding.

B.3 During the Earnout period, Acquirer shall not take actions with the primary
    purpose of avoiding the Earnout payment. Acquirer may, however, make ordinary
    course business decisions — including pricing changes, product retirements,
    and go-to-market restructuring — without regard to Earnout impact.

B.4 No interest shall accrue on the Earnout amount during the measurement period.
""".strip(),

    "schedule_c_working_capital": """
SCHEDULE C — WORKING CAPITAL METHODOLOGY

C.1 Working Capital shall be calculated using Acquirer's standard methodology,
    which differs from GAAP in the following respects:
      (a) Deferred revenue shall be included as a current liability at full face
          value, rather than at the GAAP amortized amount;
      (b) Customer deposits held by Target shall be excluded from current assets;
      (c) Unbilled receivables (ARR contracted but not yet invoiced) shall be
          excluded from current assets.

C.2 Target acknowledges that it has not reviewed or approved Acquirer's accounting
    methodology set forth in C.1, and that application of such methodology may
    reduce the calculated Working Capital figure materially compared to Target's
    own GAAP-based calculations.

C.3 If the Working Capital at Closing, calculated per C.1, is below the target
    of $3,200,000, the purchase price shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar. If
    Working Capital exceeds $3,200,000, no upward adjustment shall be made.

C.4 Acquirer's accounting firm shall perform the final Working Capital calculation.
    Target may dispute the calculation within 15 days, but dispute resolution shall
    be by Acquirer's accounting firm's senior partner, whose determination is final.
